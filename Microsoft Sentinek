# Home Lab Security Operations Center (SOC) Setup

This project demonstrates the creation and configuration of a Security Operations Center (SOC) in a home lab environment using Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Sentinel. The environment includes a virtual machine (VM) for testing, a log analytics workspace, and monitoring capabilities to detect and respond to security incidents such as brute force RDP attempts.

## Introduction

This project showcases how to set up a fully functional SOC at home to practice real-world security operations. By following these steps, you can replicate this environment to gain hands-on experience with SIEM tools, monitoring logs, and analyzing security incidents.

---

## Environment Overview

### Tools Used
- **Microsoft Azure**: Cloud platform to host resources.
- **Microsoft Sentinel**: SIEM for monitoring, logging, and alerting.
- **Windows Server VM**: Test environment for generating and analyzing security events.

### Goals
1. Set up a secure and monitored virtual environment.
2. Simulate real-world security scenarios like brute force RDP attacks.
3. Analyze logs and configure alerts for specific security events.

---

## Steps to Build the SOC

### 1. Azure Virtual Machine Setup
- **Create an Azure Free Trial Account** to access $200 credits.
- Navigate to the Azure portal and set up a new **Resource Group** named `MadHat_Group`.
- Deploy a **Windows Server 2019/2022 Pro Virtual Machine (VM)**:
  - Name: `MadHat_VM`
  - Region: East US
  - Network: Allow **RDP (port 3389)** for remote connections.
  - Use default disk and network configurations.

- **Generate RDP Events**:
  - The exposed RDP port attracts traffic from unauthorized sources, simulating brute force attempts.

---

### 2. Deploying Microsoft Sentinel
- In Azure, search for **Microsoft Sentinel**.
- Create a **Log Analytics Workspace**:
  - Name: `MadHat_Logs`
  - Region: Match the VM region (East US) to avoid latency.
- Add Microsoft Sentinel to the workspace.

---

### 3. Configuring Data Connectors
- **Install the Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)**:
  - Go to the Sentinel workspace → `Data Connectors` → Search and install the **Azure Monitor Agent**.
- Set up a **Data Collection Rule (DCR)**:
  - Name: `WindowsEventsToSentinel`.
  - Configure the rule to collect all security events from the VM.
- Validate that logs from the VM are ingested into Sentinel.

---

### 4. Creating Analytics Rules
- Create a **Custom Sentinel Rule** to detect successful RDP logins:
  - Query: Filter successful logins excluding system accounts.
  - Set the rule to trigger alerts for initial access every 5 minutes.
  - Severity: Medium or High.
- Test the rule by logging into the VM and confirming that an incident is created in Sentinel.

---

## Key Results and Incidents
- **Incident Monitoring**:
  - Successfully ingested security events such as RDP logins.
  - Detected multiple brute force attempts from international sources (e.g., Russia, North Korea).
- **Alerts Created**:
  - Custom alert rules effectively generated incidents for unauthorized RDP access.

---

## Lessons Learned
- The importance of **restricting RDP access** to minimize attack surfaces.
- Hands-on experience configuring and managing Azure and Sentinel resources.
- Practical knowledge of data connectors, analytics rules, and log ingestion.

---

## Future Enhancements
1. **Add Threat Intelligence Feeds**:
   - Ingest custom IoC feeds to detect advanced threats.
2. **Deploy Additional Tools**:
   - Set up Security Onion for network monitoring.
3. **Automate Responses**:
   - Use Sentinel Playbooks for automated incident response.
